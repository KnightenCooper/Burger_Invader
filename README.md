# Overview

With this project I wanted to practice using functions within Python so I made a game using Arcade. 
My goals with this project was to advance my skills and become a better software engineer. I wanted more practice with Python and thought it would be fun to make a game.

My game is a version of Space Invaders but instead of aliens I used hamburgers. You play the game by using your mouse to move and clicking to throw things at the burgers. 
The burgers advance from the top of the screen and throw projectiles at you. If you at hit you lose.If you hit all the hamburgers you win.

My purpose in writing this software is to advance my skills using Python. I wanted to practice creating functions in Python. I thought it would be fun to make a game 
in Python to further my abilities.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code on a Windows machine to create this program. 

I used Python and the random, arcade, and Path libraries for this program.

# Useful Websites

* [Python Arcade Library](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)

# Future Work

* If the burgers advance past the player then the game never ends. This should be fixed in the future.
* I would like to add an animation whenever the chef throws something. It looks odd having the chef be a static image.
* I would love to add a start menu, instruction page, and multiple levels to this in the future.
